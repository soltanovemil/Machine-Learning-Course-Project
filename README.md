# Muffin vs. Chihuahua Image Classification

This project aims to classify images of muffins and chihuahuas using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The challenge arises due to the visual similarity between muffins and chihuahuas, making it an interesting problem for image classification.

## Project Overview

The repository includes:
- Data preprocessing scripts.
- Implementation of three CNN architectures: AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet.
- Training scripts using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with different learning rates.
- Evaluation and comparison of models based on accuracy and other performance metrics.
- Confusion matrices for each model and learning rate combination.

## Key Results

- **VGG16 with SGD (learning rate 0.01)** achieved the highest accuracy of 91.72%.
- Detailed results and confusion matrices are included in the report.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Follow the provided scripts to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
